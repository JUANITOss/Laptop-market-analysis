## First Project: Analyzing the Relationship Between Features in Laptops

### Description

This project aims to analyze laptop pricing (in euros) using a dataset created by Iron Wolf on Kaggle.

The dataset contains a variety of laptop specifications along with the price of each device in Euros.

My objective was to evaluate the relationships between features (shown through a heatmap graph).

**Data from:** August 2024.

### Conclussions

- The weight is directly related to the screen size (in inches).
- Pricing is strongly related to RAM and somewhat related to CPU frequency.
- More data on pricing is needed, as the dataset does not account for other CPU/GPU features.
